        Book Name: The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People
        <br><br><br>
        Author: Stephen R. Covey 
        <br><br><br>
        Category: personal development and psychology.
        <br><br><br>
        Descreption: Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which produces those results.<br>
        He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs. He claims that effectiveness can be expressed in terms of the P/PC ratio,<br>
        where P refers to getting desired results and PC is caring for that which produces the results.
